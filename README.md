## Description

>*(Finished Project)*

<br>

An interactive and rather unorthodox portfolio composed of the following complementary assets which I built from scratch:
- Navigation Bar > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Navigation-Bar) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/qBobjvx)
- Mobile Navigation Bar > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Mobile-Navigation-Bar) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/eYMJEmR)
- Responsive Carousel > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Responsive-Carousel) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/RwMrgRQ)
- Carousel Slide Transition > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Carousel-Slide-Transition) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/oNqbwME)
- Github Heatmap > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Heatmap-Github-GraphQL-API) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/LYdGWOq)
- Page Loader > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Page-Loader) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/xxWZLVj)
- Modal Window > [Github](https://github.com/Sleepyblue/Modal-Window) | [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SleepyBluee/pen/PoRZKpo)

The main objectives for this project were for it to be as interactive as possible, to avoid scrolling and to have a natural feeling for the visitor. It is both adaptive and responsive for the following layout ranges:
- Desktop (up to Full-HD)
- Laptop
- Tablet (both portrait and landscape mode)
- Mobile (both portrait and landscape mode)
